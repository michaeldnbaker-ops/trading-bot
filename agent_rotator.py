agent_rotator.py — v1.4 (2026-04-24)
────────────────────────────────────
Rotates underperforming agents out and promotes better alternatives.

CHANGE LOG (v1.4):
  • FIX: don't promote an agent that was benched earlier in the same cycle.
    AGENT_VARIANTS lists sibling ensemble agents as fallbacks. After v1.2
    enabled real benching, the fourth bench (BreakoutAgent) found
    TechnicalAgent — already benched two iterations earlier — listed as a
    variant and "promoted" it back to active. Net effect: the worst loser
    we just benched got resurrected by the next iteration.
    Track newly_benched in this cycle and exclude it from replacement
    candidates. Also clear benched_at when a promotion happens so state
    stays consistent.

CHANGE LOG (v1.3):
  • FIX: KeyError when benching an agent with no existing summary entry.
    Pre-v1.2 the rotator bailed before reaching this code path on a clean
    summary, so the bug was latent. v1.2 unblocked benching, exposing it.
    Fix mirrors the replacement-promotion path: ensure the summary entry
    exists (creating a blank one if needed) before mutating it.

CHANGE LOG (v1.2):
  • FIX: active_count was counted from agent_summary.json. An empty/clean
    summary (no benched agents) made active_count=0, and the MIN_ACTIVE_AGENTS
    safety floor immediately tripped on the first flagged agent — so nothing
    ever got benched on a fresh install. Now we count active agents from the
    EvalReport roster (excluding the MetaAgent wrapper), which reflects real
    state regardless of what's in agent_summary.json.
  • Bench worst-first: sort report.flagged_agents by 20-day P&L ascending
    so the rotator spends its bench-budget on the biggest losers instead of
    whatever order the dict happened to insert.

CHANGE LOG (v1.1):
  • Removed TechnicalAgent from PROTECTED_AGENTS — its protection wasn't
    earning its keep (9 % win rate, persistently worst-quartile P&L).
  • Now compatible with agent_evaluator v2.0 (ledger-backed). No code
    change needed here; the import surface and EvalReport shape are
    unchanged.

Rotation logic:
  1. Read the latest EvalReport from agent_evaluator.
  2. For each flagged agent, bench it (active=False) for BENCH_DAYS.
  3. Log the rotation event to logs/rotation_log.jsonl.
  4. Update agent_summary.json accordingly.
  5. Re-activate benched agents after BENCH_DAYS if they've been rested.

"Better alternatives" in this system means an agent variant with different
parameters (e.g. TechnicalAgent_v2, TechnicalAgent_conservative).
If no variant exists, the original agent is benched and the ensemble simply
runs with fewer voices until it's recalled.

Add variant agent names to AGENT_VARIANTS to enable automatic substitution.
