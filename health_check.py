health_check.py
────────────────
Autonomous watchdog. Runs hourly via cron during market hours.

Purpose: catch the class of bug that cost weeks last time (dead cron,
duplicate .env keys, stale ledger, broken email auth) BEFORE it silently
runs for days. Self-heals what's safe to auto-fix. CRITICAL findings
email/log only — Slack outbound is hard-disabled (webhook ignored).

Checks:
  1. Duplicate keys in .env (auto-fixes: keeps last occurrence, the one
     python-dotenv actually uses, so behavior doesn't silently change)
  2. scheduler.log has fresh entries within the last 10 minutes during
     market hours (bot process actually alive)
  3. Ledger (paper_trades.csv) has today's trades if market has been open
  4. Gmail send actually works (sends a silent test, not a real report)
  5. No single agent has 5+ duplicate open positions on the same symbol+side
     (regression check for the dedup bug fixed 2026-07-01)

Cron (add to crontab -e):
