meta_agent.py — v1.1 (2026-04-24)
─────────────────────────────────
Portfolio manager for the 12-agent ensemble. Does three jobs:

1. REGIME WEIGHTING — asks RegimeDetector what market conditions look like,
   then boosts agents that specialize in those conditions.

2. PROFIT WEIGHTING — agents that have made more money get more say.
   Uses a power curve so top earners are rewarded aggressively.

3. SYNTHESIS — merges agreeing signals, resolves conflicts by keeping
   the dominant direction, filters by confidence, and returns top signals.

Agent Roster (12 signal agents + RiskAgent monitor):
  Upswing:    TechnicalAgent, MomentumAgent, BreakoutAgent
  Downswing:  TechnicalAgent (short), BearishPatternAgent, ShortMomentumAgent
  Catalyst:   EarningsAgent, MacroAgent
  Flow:       NewsAgent, SentimentAgent, OptionsFlowAgent
  Timing:     PremarketAgent, SectorRotationAgent

The MetaAgent actively promotes agents that are performing and are in
their best regime — like a coach putting their best players on the field.

CHANGE LOG (v1.1):
  • _load_performance_weights() now reads from trade_ledger.py instead of
    PerformanceLogger (which was always empty in production, so every
    agent silently fell back to DEFAULT_WEIGHTS=1.0 — the soft layer of
    the two-layer defense was inert).
  • P&L attribution counts BOTH primary_agent AND contributors, matching
    agent_evaluator v2 so weighting and rotation use the same source of
    truth.
  • Open positions (unrealized P&L) now influence weights — if an agent
    is bleeding right now, MetaAgent doesn't wait for the trade to close
    before muting it.
  • Negative-P&L agents collapse to MIN_AGENT_WEIGHT (0.15). Whole-
    ensemble-underwater windows collapse everyone to the floor (so we
    stop amplifying any agent until somebody recovers).

        Read agent 20-day P&L from trade_ledger and compute relative weights.

        Incentive system — agents are rewarded for TOTAL PROFIT:
          • Top earner always gets weight 1.0
          • Others scaled by (their_pnl / top_pnl) ^ PROFIT_WEIGHT_EXPONENT
          • Power curve (exponent < 1) means the gap is larger than linear:
            e.g., an agent at 50% of top P&L gets ~65% of the weight
          • Agents with negative P&L collapse to MIN_AGENT_WEIGHT (rotation
            handles outright benching; this is the continuous tilt layer)
          • If the WHOLE ensemble is underwater in the window, every agent
            collapses to MIN_AGENT_WEIGHT — we stop amplifying anyone
          • Winning-streak bonus: +0.15 weight for 3+ consecutive wins

        Data source change (v1.1, 2026-04-24): now reads from trade_ledger.py
        instead of PerformanceLogger (which was always empty in production).
