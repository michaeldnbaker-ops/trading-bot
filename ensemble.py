ensemble.py  (replaces ensemble_v11.py — market_scheduler imports THIS file)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Orchestrates the full 12-agent pipeline each trading tick.

Changes vs v11:
  • Alpaca real-time stream is started at first import; agents query the
    shared price cache via alpaca_stream.get_latest_price() when available,
    falling back to yfinance automatically.
  • Surge detection: after each tick, check for real-time surges/drops and
    emit opportunistic signals (fast-moving stocks caught by Alpaca streaming).
  • Strategy learner hooks: after cycle, record which agents fired and any
    outcome data available so the learner can improve thresholds over time.

Pipeline (one full cycle):
  1. RegimeDetector.detect()            → identify current market regime
  2. RiskAgent.assess()                 → get risk status / halt check
  3. All 12 agents generate signals     → raw signal list
  4. Surge scan (Alpaca)                → catch real-time breakouts/drops
  5. MetaAgent.synthesize()             → merge + weight by P&L + regime
  6. AgentRiskBridge.evaluate_signal()  → 7-gate validation
  7. PerformanceLogger                  → log all results
  8. Return approved signals for order execution

# added. But count was always a proxy for the real constraint, capital,
# and the proxy failed loudly on 2026-08-07: a ledger reconciliation left
# 254 phantom "open" rows against a cap of 15 and froze ALL trading during

# Net-exposure entry gate — the constraint that actually predicts the losses.
# Measured 2026-08-12: the book sat at 1.87x gross and 102% net long, and on
# Aug 10/11/12 it lost 1.2-1.5% a day while SPY was flat to UP. Realized P&L
# over those same three days was POSITIVE (+$3,399, avg loss held to -$363) —
# the trades were fine. What bled was carrying a correlated growth/tech long
# book at leverage through a flat tape.
#
# Neither existing gate binds there: buying power was $31k (reserve is $20k)
# and the 2.5x leverage invariant is a disaster ceiling, not an operating
# limit. Removing the position-count cap on 2026-08-07 was right — count was
# a bad proxy — but it left no brake at all, and gross went 1.47x -> 1.87x in
# three sessions. This is the brake that should have shipped alongside it.
#
# Shorts are exempt from both limits: they were the only profitable sleeve
# (VFC +$702, FICO +$539, GME +$361, AVGO +$296, all green) and every short
# REDUCES net exposure, so blocking them would be backwards.
# RECALIBRATED 2026-08-14. Both numbers were set on 2026-08-12 from a naive
# net figure of 102%, computed before exposure.py taught the code that a long
# inverse ETF is short exposure. Under signed exposure that same book was 64%
# net — so the 85% net gate could never bind, and the 1.60x GROSS gate silently
# became the only active brake.
#
# That is the wrong brake. Gross counts both sides, so it punishes hedging: on
# 2026-08-14 the book was 60% net long ($107,740 long against $55,125 short,
# 34% hedged) with $53,805 buying power — directionally safer than the days
# that lost money — yet every entry was rejected at 1.85x gross. Combined with
# short agents being suppressed in a bull tape, the bot deadlocked: 86 signals
# a tick, zero entries possible from either side.
#
# Net long is what actually predicted the losses, so it is the binding gate;
# gross becomes a margin/liquidity backstop, still well under the 2.5x
# invariant ceiling.
#
# HONEST CAVEAT: these levels are judgment, not measured optima. The losing
# days sat at 60-64% signed net, which is where the book sits now, so a net
# gate that would have stopped them would also stop most normal trading. What
# is needed is an exposure sweep in replay.py — the same treatment that
# corrected the ATR stop — rather than another number picked by argument.

#     net 50%  Sharpe 0.13   CAGR 0.8%
#     net 70%  Sharpe 0.15   CAGR 1.2%   <- what I shipped, and it was wrong

            # was wrong, and the reasoning behind it was wrong too.
            #
            # The premise was that a 4% stop sits inside the noise band and
            # causes shake-outs. The noise part is true; the conclusion is
            # not. Widening barely changes the shake-out rate but costs a
            # lot of profit:
            #     shake-out rate   4% -> 77%,  12% -> 75%   (2 points)
            #     avg trade        4% -> +$89, 12% -> +$67
            # And in the regime that decides survival, 2022 (SPY -18.6%):
            #     4%  +$96/trade  PF 1.56
            #     8%  +$53/trade  PF 1.32

            # In the 2023 rally all three tie (~+$135), so the tight stop is
            # nearly free upside and large downside insurance.
            #
            # Why: a tight stop buys more notional per dollar risked, so the
            # winners that DO run pay several times more, while every loser
            # costs the same fixed budget. Getting shaken out often is the
