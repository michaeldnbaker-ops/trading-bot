──────────────
Continuous assertions about what must ALWAYS be true.

Why this exists. Four reporting bugs shipped in one week, all silent, all
flattering, and every one violated a rule nobody was checking:

  ledger P&L vs broker equity        $22,000 error   (nothing compared them)
  dead trade_log.jsonl as source     trades vanished (nothing checked freshness)
  history index read as "today"      $6,960 error    (nothing compared to live)
  expiry booked open gains as real   $11,003 error   (nothing checked double-count)

The structural cause is visible in one line: FIVE modules can close a
position (crypto_scheduler, ensemble, market_scheduler, options_executor,
trade_ledger) and SEVEN can compute P&L. Whenever two systems decide the
same thing independently, they eventually disagree — and without an
assertion, the disagreement is silent.

This module cannot fix that architecture. What it does is make any
divergence LOUD and IMMEDIATE, so the next one is caught in an hour
rather than after it has distorted a week of decisions.

Two layers:
  1. INVARIANTS  — explicit rules. Catch known failure shapes.
  2. ANOMALIES   — statistical. Catch shapes nobody has thought of yet,
                   by flagging any metric far outside its own history.

Severity: CRITICAL alerts immediately, WARN goes in the report, INFO logs.
