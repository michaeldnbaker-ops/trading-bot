───────────────
Pre-deploy smoke test. Catches the class of bug that has caused most of the
recent breakage: a change that is individually reasonable but does not
actually CONNECT to the thing it was meant to affect.

Every failure below is one that shipped to a live bot this week:

  regime name typo      MeanReversionAgent declared ["BULL","NEUTRAL",
                        "VOLATILE"]; regime_detector emits BULL_TREND /
                        HIGH_VOL. The intersection never matched, so the
                        agent was silent in the regime it is best in.
  undefined import      meta_agent used os.getenv without importing os —
                        would have crashed the module and taken the bot down.
  arithmetic mute       regime aversion subtracted 0.35 from agents already
                        on the 0.40 floor, leaving 0.15. No short could ever
                        clear the 0.72 solo bar; a lean became a gag.
  gate deadlock         gross and net entry gates set so that no entry of
                        either direction could pass.

None of these needed a backtest to catch. They needed thirty seconds of
verification that nobody was doing. Run this before every restart.

    python3 config_check.py   # exit 0 = safe to deploy

    ~279, and ~280 restores raw for solo signals), so weight never blocks
    a solo entry. Acting on that reading would have "fixed" a bug that did
    not exist — the exact failure mode this file is meant to prevent, so
    the check is kept honest rather than deleted.
