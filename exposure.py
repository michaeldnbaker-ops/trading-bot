───────────
Signed market exposure of a position, in equity-equivalent dollars.

Why this is not just `market_value`. On 2026-08-12 the book held SPY long
AND SQQQ long. Naive arithmetic read that as +$16,640 of long exposure. In
economic terms SQQQ is a 3x INVERSE Nasdaq fund: $8,142 of it carries about
-$24,400 of directional exposure. The book was therefore far less net-long
than market_value implied, and a gate reading market_value would both
misjudge the risk and refuse entries for the wrong reason.

Leveraged and inverse ETFs are the only instruments where notional and
market value diverge like this, so a small explicit table beats inferring
it. Anything absent from the table behaves normally: exposure == value.

Note these funds reset leverage daily and decay when held — the multiplier
describes today's directional risk, not a durable position value.
